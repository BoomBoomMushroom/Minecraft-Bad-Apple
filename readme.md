DataPack <br>
To install the datapack unzip the .zip file and put it into the datapacks folder of your world <br>

Code <br>

To get the frames make a frames folder in the same directory as the rest of the .py and .mp4 files <br>
Then run the 'frameExtractor.py' to generate all ~7,777 frames <br>
After that edit 'load_frame.py', 'apple.py' and 'cleanup.py' and change the path to the functions folder of the datapack <br>
Finally you want to run 'apple.py' and wait for that to finish, then run 'cleanup.py', after that is finished run 'load_frame.py' <br>
Now you have compiled you program! Feel free to take a look and play around with the code and maybe even optimise it. <br>
The output will be mirrored so to unmirror it you need to mirror the .mp4 in a video editor (I would upload the mirrored version but the file is too big) <br>
