DataPack
To install the datapack unzip the .zip file and put it into the datapacks folder of your world

Code
To get the frames make a frames folder in the same directory as the rest of the .py and .mp4 files
Then run the 'frameExtractor.py' to generate all ~7,777 frames
After that edit 'load_frame.py', 'apple.py' and 'cleanup.py' and change the path to the functions folder of the datapack
Finally you want to run 'apple.py' and wait for that to finish, then run 'cleanup.py', after that is finished run 'load_frame.py'
Now you have compiled you program! Feel free to take a look and play around with the code and maybe even optimise it.
